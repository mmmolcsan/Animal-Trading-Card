			<p>These birds start their year in the Caribbean. They can fly over 1,200 miles without stopping to rest. In order to prepare for the migration, they put on about an extra 30% of their body weight. They live in Canada and the United States during the summer months. You can see them in Mexico while they are moving from one location to the other.</p>
